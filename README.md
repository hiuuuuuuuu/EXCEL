[Final_project_Quarter-One-Report.xlsx](https://github.com/hiuuuuuuuu/EXCEL/blob/main/Final_project_Quarter-One-Report.xlsx)

  ### Case study
Jamie, at Adventure Works, is attending a management meeting. She has been asked to prepare an Excel worksheet that presents sales figures for the first quarter of the year and compares these figures to the results for the same period in the previous year. 

This worksheet is called Summary and is in the workbook Quarter One Report.xlsx. In this worksheet, youâ€™ll need to complete the following actions:

- Create formulas that show the total quarter-one sales for both 2022 and 2023.

- Create formulas that show the percentage increase in sales in 2023. 

- And break down these totals by month with the use of further calculations.

  ### Action:
- **SUMIF** Function: Used to sum values based on specific criteria (year and month).
- **PROPER** Function: Used to standardize product names by capitalizing the first letter.
- MONTH and YEAR Functions: Used to extract the month and year from a date value.
- **IF Function**: Used to check conditions and calculate tax based on the sales amount.
- **Percentage Calculation**: Used to calculate the percentage growth to compare sales between different years.
